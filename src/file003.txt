The problem is, we don't know what you were trying to do. The code prints out 1 3 5 7 9. It "works" but it's not what the person thought would print out. But we don't know that. Now if the person says: I expect all even numbers from 2 4 6 8 10 to print out, then we can help. The i%2==1 needs to change and the i<10 needs to change and it works. It's now an easy fix. You will get a more targeted response the more specific your question is.

A common follow-up to the previous paragraph is this: I don't know where the problem is or how to find it. In this case, you want to add a bunch of print statements. Learning how to debug your code is a crucial skill for any data scientist. If you are doing anything interesting, it is very rare for someone to write perfect code on the first try. One must debug the code to figure out where the issue is. A common debugging tool is to use print statements. For example, you might say: nothing prints out in my code, why not? Try and narrow it down. Start at the beginning, are you reading in the file correctly (print out each line you read in before processing it). If you aren't even reading it in correctly, then it won't print out. For another example, at the start of some if-statement, put a print statement to see if the if-statement is ever executing. It doesn't have to be fancy. Just say: System.out.println("got into the if statement!"); If it never prints out, then you know your if statement is broken somehow. All of this to say, print statements are very helpful in determining where issues are.
