This activity is designed to show a Python programmer how to write code in Java. For those of you who are familiar with Java, you are welcome to skip the explanations and simply work on the problems. Some of this is repeating what was said in the presentations but if you are new to Java, doing it in an activity is not a bad idea.

Lastly, I would discourage you from doing a lot of searching about multithreading in Java. The threading templates that are provided in the presentations and in this activity are exactly what you should be doing. If you stray too far from what is presented, you are probably making your solution a lot harder than it needs to be. In other words, if you search for “multithreading in Java,” you'll come across a ton of different ways that are a lot harder than what is in the presentations. We've seen some really, really weird solutions from people. Search at your own risk.
