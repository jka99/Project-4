In this activity, you will be learning a lot of the key classes that Java has to offer you. We will be creating a simple Java program to start. Then we will follow that up with some of the more advanced features that Java has to offer. The syntax that Java uses is very similar to Python. However, Java is a bit more stringent on how the program is set up and different rules that must be followed. 

The point of learning Java is to learn how multithreading works. I do not expect you to master the language. Therefore, if you are having problems with the syntax of Java, do not spend hours trying to figure out how to do something simple. If you cannot find a solution to some compiler/syntax error after a few minutes, ask an instructor (or ask a generic question on the message board) and someone will point you in the right direction. There are many examples in this activity to point you in the right direction. You are welcome to download the multithreaded template code to use in your multithreaded solutions:
